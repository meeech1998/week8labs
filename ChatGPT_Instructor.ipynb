    "Hi ChatGPT, I’m working on my Week 8 Instructor-led Lab for my graduate Python course (BGEN 632 - UM MSBA). \n",

    "Can you walk me through how I should structure the logic using pseudo-code or examples—without giving me the full solution? I’ll write my own code based on what I learn. # Instructor-led Lab: Advanced Data Manipulation\n",

    "\n",
    "Last week you sorted, ordered, and filtered the data [github_teams.csv](/data/github_teams.csv) using basic pandas techniques. Now that you have learned to use advanced techniques relying on piping expressions, you will perform the similar operations again, but with your new skills. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Select the columns `Team_type`, `human_work`, and `work_per_human`.\n",
    "* Select columns that end in the letter `t`. Use the regex `t$`.\n",
    "* Sort your data descending using the columns `Team_size_class`, `human_work`, `work_per_human`.\n",
    "* Select `human-bot` teams that have a `bot_members_count` value greater than and equal to 3.\n",
    "* Find the `human` teams that are `Large` and have a `human_gini` value greater than and equal to 0.75.\n",
    "* How many teams are in the `Small` or `Large` category?\n",
    "* How many teams are in the `Small` or `Large` category with a `human_gini` value less than and equal to 0.25?\n",
    "* How many `human` teams are in the `Medium` category?\n",
    "* Save the columns `Team_size_class` and `work_per_human` as a new DataFrame.\n",
    "* Rename these two columns in the new DataFrame. Change `human_gini` to `work_inequality` and `eval_survival_day_median` to `issue_resolution_time`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Think: “Use .filter([...]) to extract columns just like select() in R.”\n",

    "🔹 Task 2: Select Columns That End in ‘t’\n",
    "\n",
